Hello! Welcome to my personal GitHub portfolio! Here you can find some of my past and present work

## About me

I am a particle physics theorist by training, with an ardent drive for solving challenging and meaningful problems. I love seeking out novel approaches and techniques, and finding ways to improve upon existing methods. I find enjoyment working with and learning from others.

I am adept with Python for data analysis, visualization, and modeling, with expertise in the following libraries:
- `pandas`, `scipy`, and `numpy` for data analysis and computation
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for custom visualizations
- `scikit-learn`, `tensorflow`, and `keras` for Machine Learning/Deep Learning modeling
